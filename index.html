    <p> The visualization above presents the log MIC value for 3 drugs namely Neomycin, Penicillin and Streptomycin plotted against a list of Bacteria.
    
    <li>The different colors represent the different antibiotics.
    <li>The lower the MIC value, the better the performance of the drug against that bacteria.
        <li>The positive and the negative gram stained bacteria have been split into 2 columns and represented using different symbols.
    <li>Since the range of the values were quite wide, we have taken the log (base 10) of those value to represent them visually.
    <li>Multiple bars are presented in order to compare which antibiotics work the best for that particular bacteria.
        <li>Looking at the graph, the best antibiotic for a particular bacteria can be determined.
